Did you know GitHub Actions can automate almost anything in your workflow? From running tests every time you push code to deploying your website with a single click, it’s like having a superpower right in your repo. My first workflow was super simple—just checking out code and running tests—but seeing it execute automatically felt like magic! The best part? It’s all configured with YAML, which is surprisingly easy to learn. If you haven’t tried it yet, GitHub Actions might just become your new favorite tool.
